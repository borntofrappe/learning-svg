The idea of this project comes from the inspiring website [joshwcomeau.com](https://joshwcomeau.com/). In the landing page, visitors have the option, among other things, to change the experience based on two toggles:

- light/dark color mode

- mute/volume

Here the idea is to recreate the toggles using SVG syntax and CSS animations. With just enough JavaScript to toggle a class.
