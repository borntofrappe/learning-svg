The idea of this project comes from the inspiring website [joshwcomeau.com](https://joshwcomeau.com/). In the landing page, visitors have the option, among other things, to change the color palette between a light and dark mode.

The toggle is animated through an interesting visual and with a peculiar easing function, which I try to replicate in this demo.
